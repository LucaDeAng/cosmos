# BCG Growth-Share Matrix

## Overview
The BCG Matrix (Boston Consulting Group Matrix), also known as the Growth-Share Matrix, is a portfolio planning model developed by Bruce Henderson in 1970. It helps organizations analyze their business units or product lines based on market growth and relative market share.

## The Four Quadrants

### ⭐ Stars (High Growth, High Share)
**Position:** Upper-left quadrant
**Cash Flow:** Roughly neutral (high generation, high investment needs)

**Characteristics:**

- Require significant investment to maintain position
- Generate substantial revenue
- Future cash cows if market share is maintained

**IT Portfolio Equivalent:**
- Digital platforms with rapid user growth
- Strategic transformation programs
- New customer-facing applications gaining traction
- High-value integration projects

**Strategy:** **INVEST** - Pour resources to maintain leadership as market grows

**Metrics to Watch:**
- User/customer growth rate
- Market share trend
- Competitive position
- Investment efficiency

### 💰 Cash Cows (Low Growth, High Share)
**Position:** Lower-left quadrant
**Cash Flow:** Strong positive (high generation, low investment needs)

**Characteristics:**
- Market leaders in mature markets
- Generate excess cash beyond maintenance needs
- Provide funds for Stars and Question Marks
- Require minimal investment to maintain

**IT Portfolio Equivalent:**
- Mature ERP systems

**Strategy:** **HARVEST** - Maximize cash extraction, invest minimally

**Metrics to Watch:**

### ❓ Question Marks (High Growth, Low Share)
**Position:** Upper-right quadrant
**Cash Flow:** Negative (low generation, high investment needs)

**Characteristics:**
- Low market share in high-growth markets
- Require substantial investment to grow share
- Uncertain future - could become Stars or Dogs
- Strategic decision point: invest heavily or divest

**IT Portfolio Equivalent:**

- Consume resources without strategic benefit
- May have emotional/historical attachment
- Often candidates for divestment

**IT Portfolio Equivalent:**
- Legacy systems with declining usage
- Redundant applications
- Failed initiatives not yet retired
- Point solutions superseded by platforms

**Strategy:** **DIVEST** - Retire, replace, or minimize investment

**Metrics to Watch:**
- Total cost of ownership
- User adoption trend
- Strategic relevance
- Replacement options

## Application to IT Portfolio Assessment

### Classification Criteria

**Market Growth (Y-axis) - For IT: Strategic Value Growth**

| Score | Growth Rate | IT Portfolio Indicator |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| High | >10% annually | High demand, strategic priority, expanding user base |
| Low | <10% annually | Stable/declining demand, mature capability, limited expansion |

**Relative Market Share (X-axis) - For IT: Adoption & Impact**

| Score | Share Position | IT Portfolio Indicator |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| High | Leader | High user adoption, business-critical, competitive advantage |
| Low | Follower | Low adoption, limited impact, alternatives exist |

### Scoring Model for IT Initiatives

**Strategic Value Growth Score (1-10):**
- Business growth enablement: 0-3 points
- User/adoption growth rate: 0-3 points
- Strategic alignment trend: 0-2 points
- Innovation contribution: 0-2 points

**Adoption & Impact Score (1-10):**
- User adoption rate: 0-3 points
- Business process coverage: 0-3 points
- Revenue/cost impact: 0-2 points
- Competitive differentiation: 0-2 points

### Quadrant Thresholds

| Quadrant | Strategic Value Growth | Adoption & Impact |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Stars | ≥6 | ≥6 |
| Cash Cows | <6 | ≥6 |
| Question Marks | ≥6 | <6 |
| Dogs | <6 | <6 |

## Portfolio Balance Recommendations

### Healthy IT Portfolio Mix

| Quadrant | % of Budget | % of Initiatives | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Stars | 35-45% | 20-30% | Drive growth |
| Cash Cows | 25-35% | 30-40% | Fund operations |
| Question Marks | 15-25% | 20-30% | Create options |
| Dogs | 5-15% | 10-20% | Manage transition |

### Rebalancing Triggers

**Too Many Dogs:**
- Technical debt accumulating
- Innovation stagnation
- Need aggressive retirement program

**No Stars:**
- Missing growth engines
- Risk of disruption
- Need strategic investment

**All Question Marks:**
- Lack of focus
- Spreading resources too thin
- Need to make tough choices

**Only Cash Cows:**
- Short-term focus
- Missing future opportunities
- Need innovation pipeline

## Dynamic Portfolio Management

The matrix is not static - initiatives should move through quadrants:

### Ideal Progression
```
Question Mark → Star → Cash Cow → (Retirement)
```

### Warning Progressions
```
Star → Question Mark (losing position)
Cash Cow → Dog (market/technology shift)
Question Mark → Dog (failed investment)
```

### Review Cadence
- **Quarterly:** Update metrics and positions
- **Annually:** Strategic rebalancing
- **Trigger-based:** Significant market/technology changes

## Best Practices

1. **Be honest about Dogs** - Emotional attachment delays necessary retirements
2. **Don't starve Stars** - Short-term budget pressure shouldn't compromise growth
3. **Decide on Question Marks** - Ambiguity wastes resources
4. **Protect Cash Cows** - They fund everything else
5. **Look for transitions** - Monitor movement between quadrants
6. **Consider the whole portfolio** - Individual initiative decisions affect balance
