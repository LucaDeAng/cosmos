# Gartner Hype Cycle

## Overview
The Gartner Hype Cycle is a graphical representation of the maturity, adoption, and social application of specific technologies. Created by Gartner, it helps organizations understand where technologies are in their evolution and when they might deliver productive value.

## The Five Phases

### 1. Innovation Trigger (Technology Trigger)
**Timeline:** Early emergence
**Media Attention:** Growing

**Characteristics:**
- Breakthrough, public demonstration, or product launch
- Early proof-of-concept stories generate publicity
- Often no usable products exist
- Commercial viability is unproven

**IT Portfolio Guidance:**
- **Investment Level:** Exploratory only (1-2% of innovation budget)
- **Risk Level:** Very High
- **Appropriate Actions:**
  - Monitor and track developments
  - Attend conferences and demos
  - Small innovation lab experiments
  - No production commitments

**Examples (2024-2025):**
- Quantum computing applications
- AGI developments
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Autonomous everything

### 2. Peak of Inflated Expectations
**Timeline:** 1-2 years after trigger
**Media Attention:** Maximum

**Characteristics:**
- Early publicity produces success stories
- Often accompanied by scores of failures
- Vendor scramble to capitalize on hype
- Unrealistic expectations set
- FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) peaks

**IT Portfolio Guidance:**
- **Investment Level:** Cautious pilots (3-5% of innovation budget)
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Appropriate Actions:**
  - Pilot projects with clear learning objectives
  - Set realistic expectations with stakeholders
  - Focus on learning, not production outcomes
  - Avoid large-scale commitments

**Warning Signs:**
- Vendor claims seem too good to be true
- Everyone is talking about it
- No clear ROI models exist
- "Revolutionary" and "disruptive" overused

### 3. Trough of Disillusionment
**Timeline:** 2-5 years after trigger
**Media Attention:** Declining/Negative

**Characteristics:**
- Interest wanes as experiments fail
- Producers shake out or fail
- Investments continue only if surviving providers improve
- Media focus on failures

**IT Portfolio Guidance:**
- **Investment Level:** Strategic evaluation (5-10% of innovation budget)
- **Risk Level:** Medium-High
- **Appropriate Actions:**
  - Evaluate which vendors will survive
  - Learn from early adopter failures
  - Identify proven use cases
  - Begin building internal capabilities
  - Prepare for future adoption

**Opportunity:** Best time to build skills and relationships at lower cost

### 4. Slope of Enlightenment
**Timeline:** 5-8 years after trigger
**Media Attention:** Balanced/Practical

**Characteristics:**
- Real-world benefits become clearer
- Second and third-generation products appear
- More enterprises fund pilots
- Conservative companies remain cautious

**IT Portfolio Guidance:**
- **Investment Level:** Strategic projects (10-20% of relevant budget)
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Appropriate Actions:**
  - Production pilots with business sponsors
  - Develop implementation methodologies
  - Build center of excellence
  - Create vendor partnerships
  - Plan broader rollout

**Key Questions:**
- Is the business case proven for our industry?
- Do vendors have stable, mature products?
- Are skilled resources available?
- Can we integrate with existing systems?

### 5. Plateau of Productivity
**Timeline:** 8-10+ years after trigger
**Media Attention:** Mainstream

**Characteristics:**
- Mainstream adoption starts
- Criteria for viability are more clearly defined
- Broad market applicability pays off
- Technology becomes standard

**IT Portfolio Guidance:**
- **Investment Level:** Standard project funding
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Appropriate Actions:**
  - Full production implementation
  - Leverage best practices
  - Optimize and scale
  - Focus on business outcomes
  - Consider it foundational capability

**Expectation:** This is now "table stakes" - not having it is a risk

## Time to Plateau Estimates

Gartner provides "years to mainstream adoption" estimates:

| Estimate | Timeline | Portfolio Approach |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Less than 2 years | Imminent | Prepare for adoption |
| 2 to 5 years | Near-term | Build capabilities now |
| 5 to 10 years | Mid-term | Strategic evaluation |
| More than 10 years | Long-term | Monitor only |
| Obsolete before plateau | N/A | Avoid investment |

## Application to IT Portfolio Decisions

### Technology Assessment Matrix

For each technology in your portfolio, assess:

| Factor | Score 1-5 | Weight |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Hype Cycle Position | Based on phase | 20% |
| Business Relevance | Industry applicability | 25% |
| Vendor Maturity | Product/support stability | 20% |
| Skills Availability | Internal/market talent | 15% |
| Integration Complexity | Fit with existing stack | 20% |

### Investment Timing Framework

| Hype Cycle Phase | Risk Tolerance Required | Recommended Investment |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Innovation Trigger | Very High (Innovators) | <5% of innovation budget |
| Peak of Expectations | High (Early Adopters) | 5-10% of innovation budget |
| Trough | Medium-High (Strategic) | 10-15% for capability building |
| Slope | Medium (Fast Followers) | 15-25% for production pilots |
| Plateau | Low (Mainstream) | Standard project funding |

### Decision Framework by Company Type

**Innovation Leaders (Top 10% risk tolerance):**
- Invest at Innovation Trigger
- Accept high failure rate
- Aim for competitive advantage

**Fast Followers (Top 25% risk tolerance):**
- Invest at Trough/early Slope
- Learn from leader failures
- Balance innovation and stability

**Mainstream (Middle 50%):**
- Invest at Slope/early Plateau
- Proven use cases required
- Vendor stability essential

**Conservative (Bottom 25%):**
- Invest only at Plateau
- Full market validation required
- Minimize technology risk

## Portfolio Health Check

### Warning Signs

**Over-indexed on Hype:**
- Multiple projects at Peak of Expectations
- No production success stories
- High project failure rate
- Vendor churn

**Over-indexed on Plateau:**
- No innovation pipeline
- Competitors gaining advantage
- Missing transformation opportunities
- Technical stagnation

### Healthy Technology Portfolio

| Hype Cycle Phase | % of Technology Portfolio |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Innovation Trigger | 5-10% (exploration) |
| Peak | 10-15% (cautious pilots) |
| Trough | 15-20% (strategic evaluation) |
| Slope | 25-30% (production pilots) |
| Plateau | 30-40% (mainstream) |

## Best Practices

1. **Know your risk tolerance** - Align investment timing with organizational culture
2. **Don't chase hype** - Peak investments rarely pay off
3. **Buy in the Trough** - Best deals and learning opportunities
4. **Plan for the Slope** - Build capabilities before mainstream rush
5. **Don't ignore Plateau** - It's when real value is delivered
6. **Update annually** - Technologies move through the cycle
