# McKinsey 7S Framework

## Overview
The McKinsey 7S Framework is a management model developed by consultants Tom Peters and Robert Waterman at McKinsey & Company in the 1980s. It identifies seven internal elements of an organization that need to be aligned for success.

## The 7 Elements

### Hard Elements (Easier to identify and manage)

#### 1. Strategy
The plan devised to build and maintain competitive advantage over the competition.

**Key Questions:**
- What is our strategy to achieve our objectives?
- How do we deal with competitive pressure?
- How do we adapt to changing customer needs?
- How is strategy adjusted for environmental issues?

**IT Portfolio Implications:**
- Initiatives should directly support strategic objectives
- Technology investments must align with business strategy
- Digital transformation programs should enable strategy execution

#### 2. Structure
The way the organization is structured and who reports to whom.

**Key Questions:**
- How is the company/team divided?
- What is the hierarchy?
- How do departments coordinate activities?
- Is decision making centralized or decentralized?

**IT Portfolio Implications:**
- Systems architecture should mirror organizational structure
- Integration points needed where departments collaborate
- Governance structures for IT investment decisions

#### 3. Systems
The daily activities and procedures that staff members engage in to get the job done.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the main systems that run the organization?
- Where are the controls and how are they monitored?
- What internal rules and processes does the team use?

**IT Portfolio Implications:**
- Core systems (ERP, CRM, HRM) must be maintained
- Process automation opportunities
- Data flows and integration requirements

### Soft Elements (Harder to describe, less tangible)

#### 4. Shared Values (Superordinate Goals)
The core values of the organization, shown in corporate culture and work ethic.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the core values?
- What is the corporate/team culture?
- How strong are the values?
- What are the fundamental values the company was built on?

**IT Portfolio Implications:**
- Technology choices should reflect organizational values
- User experience aligned with culture
- Innovation vs. stability balance

#### 5. Style
The leadership style adopted and the overall operating style.

**Key Questions:**
- How participative is management/leadership?
- How effective is that leadership?
- Do employees/team members tend to be competitive or cooperative?
- Are there real teams or just nominal groups?

**IT Portfolio Implications:**
- Agile vs. Waterfall methodology selection
- Self-service vs. centralized IT services
- Shadow IT management approach

#### 6. Staff
The employees and their general capabilities.

**Key Questions:**
- What positions or specializations are represented?
- What positions need to be filled?
- Are there gaps in required competencies?

**IT Portfolio Implications:**
- Skills availability for project execution
- Training and capability building needs
- Build vs. buy decisions based on staff capabilities

#### 7. Skills
The actual skills and competencies of the organization's employees.

**Key Questions:**
- What skills are most important?
- Are there any skills gaps?
- What is the company/team known for doing well?
- Do the current employees/team members have the ability to do the job?

**IT Portfolio Implications:**
- Technology choices based on team competencies
- Training investments as part of transformation
- Partner/vendor selection to fill gaps

## Application to IT Portfolio Management

### Strategic Alignment Assessment

When assessing IT initiatives, evaluate alignment across all 7S:

| Element | Assessment Questions for IT Initiatives |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| Strategy | Does this initiative directly enable strategic objectives? |
| Structure | Does the organizational structure support this initiative? |
| Systems | How does this integrate with existing systems? |
| Shared Values | Is this consistent with our organizational culture? |
| Style | Does leadership style support the change required? |
| Staff | Do we have the right people for this initiative? |
| Skills | Do we have or can we acquire the necessary skills? |

### Scoring Matrix

Rate each initiative 1-5 on 7S alignment:

- **5 - Strong Alignment**: Initiative strongly reinforces this element
- **4 - Good Alignment**: Initiative supports this element
- **3 - Neutral**: No significant impact
- **2 - Weak Alignment**: Some tension with this element
- **1 - Misalignment**: Initiative conflicts with this element

**7S Alignment Score** = Sum of all 7 ratings / 35 × 100

### Red Flags

Watch for initiatives that:
- Score below 3 on Strategy alignment (must-have alignment)
- Score 1-2 on more than 2 elements (systemic misalignment)
- Have high Structure/Systems scores but low Staff/Skills (execution risk)
- Have high Strategy score but low Shared Values (cultural resistance risk)

## Best Practices

1. **Never optimize one S in isolation** - Changes in one element affect all others
2. **Start with Shared Values** - They're central to all other elements
3. **Balance Hard and Soft** - Technical excellence without cultural fit fails
4. **Assess current and target state** - Identify gaps in each S
5. **Plan transitions** - How will each S evolve during transformation?
