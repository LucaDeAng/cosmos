# McKinsey Three Horizons of Growth

## Overview
The Three Horizons framework, developed by McKinsey & Company, helps organizations manage current performance while maximizing future growth opportunities. It provides a structured way to categorize and balance initiatives across different time frames and risk profiles.

## The Three Horizons

### Horizon 1 (H1): Core Business
**Time Frame:** 0-12 months
**Focus:** Defend and extend current core businesses

**Characteristics:**
- Generates most of today's cash flow and profits
- Improvements to existing products/services
- Operational efficiency gains
- Incremental innovation
- Low risk, predictable returns

**IT Portfolio Examples:**
- System upgrades and maintenance
- Process automation of existing workflows
- Performance optimization
- Security enhancements
- Compliance updates
- Bug fixes and technical debt reduction

**Budget Allocation (Typical):** 70% of IT budget
**Expected ROI:** High certainty, modest returns (10-20%)

### Horizon 2 (H2): Emerging Opportunities
**Time Frame:** 12-36 months
**Focus:** Nurture emerging businesses

**Characteristics:**
- New ventures that may become tomorrow's core
- Adjacent market expansion
- New business models being piloted
- Moderate risk, higher potential returns
- Requires dedicated resources and attention

**IT Portfolio Examples:**
- Digital transformation programs
- New customer channels (mobile apps, portals)
- Analytics and BI platforms
- Cloud migration initiatives
- API platforms and ecosystems
- New CRM/ERP implementations

**Budget Allocation (Typical):** 20% of IT budget
**Expected ROI:** Medium certainty, good returns (20-50%)

### Horizon 3 (H3): Transformational Ideas
**Time Frame:** 36-72 months
**Focus:** Create viable options for future growth

**Characteristics:**
- Seeds of future businesses
- Emerging technologies exploration
- Disruptive innovation experiments
- High risk, potentially very high returns
- Small investments to learn and adapt

**IT Portfolio Examples:**
- AI/ML experiments
- Blockchain pilots
- IoT proof of concepts
- Emerging technology labs
- Innovation hackathons
- Strategic partnerships with startups

**Budget Allocation (Typical):** 10% of IT budget
**Expected ROI:** Low certainty, potentially transformational returns (100%+)

## Portfolio Balance Assessment

### Healthy Portfolio Distribution

| Horizon | Budget % | Initiatives % | Strategic Value |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| H1 | 70% | 50-60% | Maintain operations |
| H2 | 20% | 25-35% | Drive growth |
| H3 | 10% | 10-20% | Create options |

### Warning Signs

**Over-invested in H1:**
- Portfolio dominated by maintenance and operations
- No path to future growth
- Risk of disruption by competitors
- "Running to stand still"

**Under-invested in H1:**
- Core systems neglected
- Technical debt accumulating
- Operational stability at risk
- Customer experience degrading

**Missing H3:**
- No innovation pipeline
- Not tracking emerging technologies
- Competitors may leapfrog
- Limited strategic options

## Application to Initiative Prioritization

### Horizon Classification Criteria

| Criterion | H1 | H2 | H3 |
|-----------|----|----|----| 
| Time to value | <12 months | 12-36 months | 36+ months |
| Risk level | Low | Medium | High |
| Innovation type | Incremental | Adjacent | Disruptive |
| Market | Existing | Adjacent | New |
| Technology | Mature | Emerging | Experimental |
| Funding model | OpEx/standard | Project-based | Venture-style |

### Scoring for Portfolio Classification

**Horizon Score Calculation:**

For each initiative, score these factors (1-5):

1. **Technology Maturity** (1=experimental, 5=proven)
2. **Market Certainty** (1=unknown, 5=well-understood)
3. **Revenue Timeline** (1=5+ years, 5=immediate)
4. **Business Model Clarity** (1=undefined, 5=proven)
5. **Resource Requirements** (1=specialized/new, 5=available)

**Classification:**
- Score 20-25: **Horizon 1** (core operations)
- Score 12-19: **Horizon 2** (emerging opportunity)
- Score 5-11: **Horizon 3** (transformational)

## Strategic Recommendations by Horizon

### H1 Initiatives: Optimize and Protect
- **Governance:** Standard project management
- **Metrics:** ROI, cost savings, efficiency gains
- **Risk tolerance:** Low - failure impacts operations
- **Decision criteria:** Business case with proven ROI
- **Review frequency:** Monthly

### H2 Initiatives: Scale and Experiment
- **Governance:** Agile with business sponsorship
- **Metrics:** Market adoption, revenue growth potential
- **Risk tolerance:** Medium - accept some failures
- **Decision criteria:** Strategic fit + growth potential
- **Review frequency:** Quarterly with pivot options

### H3 Initiatives: Learn and Adapt
- **Governance:** Innovation lab / venture approach
- **Metrics:** Learning, options created, capabilities built
- **Risk tolerance:** High - expect many to fail
- **Decision criteria:** Strategic relevance + learning value
- **Review frequency:** Milestone-based with kill criteria

## Migration Between Horizons

Initiatives should progress through horizons:

```
H3 → H2 → H1
(Experiment) → (Scale) → (Operate)
```

**H3 to H2 Criteria:**
- Technology proven viable
- Business model validated
- Initial customer/user adoption
- Clear path to scale

**H2 to H1 Criteria:**
- Consistent revenue/value generation
- Operational stability achieved
- Support model established
- Integrated with core systems

## Best Practices

1. **Balance the portfolio** - Don't neglect any horizon
2. **Fund appropriately** - Different horizons need different funding models
3. **Govern differently** - Apply right governance to each horizon
4. **Track migration** - Monitor initiative progression between horizons
5. **Kill early** - H3 failures are learning opportunities, not mistakes
6. **Protect H2** - Don't let H1 priorities starve emerging opportunities
